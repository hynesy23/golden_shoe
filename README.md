# Golden Shoe Case Study

This project is a case study for AND Digital

## Description

For this case study, I needed to redesign a fictional footwear retailer's website.

The frontend is creating in React, using create-reat-app. The server is built using node and expressjs, and it uses a MYSQL database with Sequelize as an ORM.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:hynesy23/golden_shoe.git
cd golden_shoe
npm run start
```

npm run start will run the React app, however, you need to seed databse run the server as well. To seed db:

```
npm run seed
```

To run server:
```
npm run dev
```
